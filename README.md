# Employee-Performance-and-Attrition-Prediction

## Introduction

Employees are the backbone of any organization, and the success of a company largely depends on its committed, motivated, and productive workforce. When employees are engaged and aligned with the company's goals and objectives, they contribute significantly to its growth and success.


However, employee attrition—the rate at which employees leave their jobs—can negatively impact an organization's financial performance, productivity, and overall efficiency. While some level of attrition is inevitable as employees may leave for various reasons, such as seeking better opportunities, dealing with mental health issues, experiencing burnout from excessive working hours, or working in a toxic environment or under poor management, it becomes a major concern when it surpasses a certain threshold. A high attrition rate, especially when new employees leave within the first few years, may indicate underlying issues with the company culture or management practices.

To address employee attrition effectively, it is crucial to understand the factors driving employees to leave. By identifying these reasons, organizations can implement strategies to improve retention and foster a more supportive and engaging work environment.

To explore the correlations between various factors and employee attrition, we utilized the IBM Employee Attrition dataset to analyze and visualize significant patterns and trends. We employed libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Furthermore, we trained multiple machine learning models to predict whether an employee would leave the organization based on several input features related to attrition factors. We then evaluated the performance of these models using various metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, to determine their effectiveness in predicting employee turnover.

## Data
For this project, we utilized an IBM employee dataset available on Kaggle, which includes a range of personal and professional information about employees, such as attrition status, age, monthly income, and more. The dataset was last updated in 2017 and is complete with no missing data, making it straightforward to work with.
